..  TODO:
    Add modules? Perhaps this could go in the engine overview too? E.g. where does each thing live?
    * states, systems, components / entities / resources, events, environments, utils, bundles, file io
    Prototype Lessions Learned
    * Compared ggez, piston, aymest (and their verions)
    * Table of features
    * Note X11 issue?
    Someplace mention that refactoring is OK?
