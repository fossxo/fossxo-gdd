UI Concept Drawings
===================
This directory contains the user interface concept drawings for the FoxXO
game. These are created by LibreOffice.

These drawings are automatically included in the game design document as part
of the build process.

The `ttt-screen.otg` LibreOffice template contains common elements and styles
that provides a useful starting point for Tic Tac Toe screens.

Please try to keep the drawings 5in x 4in or smaller.
