# This file provides details about each environment in the game.
#
# This is used as to generate the documentation related to environments.
# This provides a central place for this information allowing us to ensure
# diversity among the environments.
#
# For each environment include the following data:
#   name: Short but descriptive name of the environment. Use Title Case.
#   concept_art: (optional) Path to the concept art image excluding the file ext.
#   marks_and_grid: |
#     Describe the marks and grid, including colors, textures, animations, and
#     sound FX. Additionally, describe any mark variations.
#     Things to consider describing are:
#     - Mark placement
#     - How a win is indicated
#     - Mouse hover over a free square
#     - Mark / grid idle animations
#     - Trying to place a mark on an owned square
#   background: |
#     Describe the background scenery. This includes any variations.
#   music_theme: The type or genera of music of the environment.
#   details: |
#     (optional) Any additional details that do not fit in the categories
#     above. For example, include special environment introduction animations,
#     environment specific sound FX,  or if there are special considerations for
#     speedrun mode.
#
# The marks_and_grid, background, and details can be multiple lines log and can
# use **bold**, *italic*, and ``mono space``, formatting if needed.
#
# Describe each environment in sufficient detail to convey your idea; sometimes
# a few words and a concept drawing will be sufficient.


- name: Tic Tac Toe Blueprint
  music_theme: Background or thinking music
  marks_and_grid: |
    The blueprint uses white text for the marks and white lines for the grid.

    The grid can actually be a series of empty boxes but using thicker interior
    lines.

    Hovering over an empty square shows a dotted version of what would be drawn
    there. Clicking places the mark without further animation.

    Winning the game causes a "Winning Marks" label to be placed with arrows
    pointing to the corresponding marks.
  background: |
    The background is predominantly deep blue. Additional, details are included
    in white.

    There is a title block with the game's name, author, version number, etc.

    Measurement lines indicate the unit less distance between features.

    The grid, squares, marks, etc are pointed to by arrows with labels.
    Additional notes describe the music being played or point out the key
    bindings.
  details: |
    This environment provides an opportunity to point out features of the game
    that might be overlooked by players such as keyboard support.

    This environment makes a template when creating new environments. This is
    due to it literally being a blueprint.


- name: Notebook Paper and Pencil
  concept_art: img/concept-art/paper
  music_theme: Mild background music
  marks_and_grid: |
    The marks and grid are dark graphite from a \#2 pencil. Each mark is
    slightly different and the grid lines are not perfectly straight to give
    it a hand drawn look. Likewise, mark placement is animated like one writing
    an X or O while a corresponding pencil sound FX is played.

    A line is drawn through the winning marks.
  background: |
    The background consists of notebook or engineering paper. Notebook paper is
    white with gray or blue lines. Often times there also a vertical red margin
    line.

    Engineering paper us yellow with gray grid lines.

- name: Pen on Scrap Paper
  music_theme: Something with a gospel / churchy vibe
  marks_and_grid: |
    The marks and grid are created from blue or red ink. Like the
    *Notebook Paper and Pencil* environment, each mark is hand drawn with
    corresponding animations and sound FX.

    A line is drawn through the winning marks.
  background: |
    Various bits of scrap paper are used for the background. This can include
    but is not limited to bank deposit slip, various store receipts, or any
    other paper someone might have in their purse.

    Text on the paper should be gray, faded black, or otherwise not interfere
    with the visibility of the marks.
  details: |
    The mark / grid color and the background image is randomly selected each
    time the environment is played. Blue and red ink is used so the marks stand
    out from the

    The inspiration from this environment comes from me not paying attention in
    church and drawing on scrap paper my mom happened to have.


- name: Neon Lights
  concept_art: img/concept-art/neon
  music_theme: 80's electronic
  marks_and_grid: |
    The marks and grid are created from luminescent orange, pink and / or blue
    neon lights. Selecting a square causes the mark to illuminate with a
    flickering animation and an electric buzzing sound FX.

    All winning marks flash on and off with a mild electric buzz sound FX.

    When the environment first loads in non-speedrun mode the lights are not
    illuminated. Then the grid flickers on as if the transformer is starting to
    fail.
  background: |
    The background is a brick wall holding the neon lights. Ideally, the wall is
    illuminated by the lights. E.g. when a mark is selected the brick wall behind
    the mark gains some illumination as shown in the concept art.
  details: |
    This environment provides an opportunity to show off the game's graphics
    including lighting FX.


- name: Early Computer
  concept_art: img/concept-art/computer
  music_theme: 8-bit electronic
  marks_and_grid: |
    The marks and grid are green or amber ASCII characters displayed on a low
    resolution monochrome computer screen. E.g. individual pixels are
    distinguishable. The marks in winning squares blink on and off.

    A blinking cursor is shown when players mouse hover over a empty squares.
    A cliché beeping sound FX is played when squares are placed.

    When the environment loads in non-speedrun mode each line of ASCII text is
    drawn as if the game was being loaded over a 300 baud modem.
  background: |
    The background is a monochrome computer monitor with the an off white bezel
    and red LED near the power button. The background color is dark green or
    dark amber with perhaps the dark pixels still visible.


- name: Sidewalk
  concept_art: img/concept-art/sidewalk
  music_theme: Hip Hob / R&B
  marks_and_grid: |
    The marks and grid are created from pastel sidewalk chalk. The lines are
    thick and hand drawn with similar animations as the *Notebook Paper and Pencil*
    environment.

    Pastel colors include red, blue, yellow, ping, green, and orange. The X, O,
    and grid use different colors that are randomly selected each game.

    A line is drawn through the winning squares.
  background: |
    The background is a gray sidewalk or black asphalt. Imperfections such as
    cracks and twigs are visible. There might even be bits of other chalk
    drawings visible.


- name: Papyrus Paper and Fancy Calligraphy
  music_theme: Snooty classical music.
  marks_and_grid: |
    The marks and grid are drawn from a quill pen with deliberate, fancy strokes.
    Thick black ink is used. The grind lines and marks are precise but the
    stroke pressure varies as the mark is being made, thus the lines are thinner
    near the starting and ending points.

    Creating of the marks and grid are animated. A line is drawn through the
    winning squares.
  background: |
    The marks and grid are drawn on a faded tan papyrus paper. The paper's rough
    texture is clearly visible.
