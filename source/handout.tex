\section{Game Summary}
Tic Tac Toe is an unique take on a classic game. Players battle the computer or
each other in a variety of stunning environments. Each environment tells part of
the story of Tic Tac Toe from the past, present, and future. Each environment
has a strong visual theme and complementary soundtrack.


\section{Game Outline}
Tic Tac Toe is a game of strategy where two players, X and O, take turns placing
their mark in a $3\times3$ gird. The first player to get three marks in a row,
column, or diagonal wins the game. The game can also end in a draw, known as a
``cat's game,'' if all the free spaces are exhausted.

Players alternate who gets to make the first move in the game. Additionally,
each game takes place in a different environment keeping players engaged.
