' Rust uses structures and traits instead of classes and interfaces.
' This file contains custom PlantUML macros so these Rust types can be used in
' your UML diagrams.
'
' To use, first !include this file. Then use struct, trait, etc as defined below.
'
' Note: this uses the legacy PlantUML preprocessor syntax as described here:
'   https://web.archive.org/web/20190914012431/https://plantuml.com/preprocessing-legacy
' This is due to us wanting to build the documentation with old versions of
' PlantUML included with Deban. Eventually these can be replaced with the new
' preprocessor syntax.
