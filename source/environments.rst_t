Environments
############
One of the main defining features of FoxXO over other tic-tac-toe games is the
use of multiple environments. Each environment has a strong visual theme and
complementary soundtrack. [#hiddenfox]_


=====================
Environment Selection
=====================
Each game takes place on a different environment. Environments are selected using
a shuffling algorithm. [#shuffelalgorithms]_ This ensures players get to
experience each environment in a random order.
