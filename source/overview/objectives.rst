Objectives of the Project
#########################

=================================
Create Tic Tac Toe Game with Rust
=================================

=======================================
Ensure the Game is Free and Open Source
=======================================

========================
Release by RustConf 2020
========================

..  TODO:
    RustConf is August 21. 2020. https://rustconf.com/


==============================
Build Risk Reduction Prototype
==============================

..  TODO:
    Using Rust is risky, create prototype to reduce risk.
    This helps with the next objective also as we can come up with a better design.


==========================================================
Allow New Content to be Easily Added After Initial Release
==========================================================

..  TODO:
    - Ensure there are tools, guides, and documentation that allow for quick
      development.
    - Environments are a big part of the game, ensure these can be easily added.
